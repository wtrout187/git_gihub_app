# Git Mastery App - Bug Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to resolve the issues with the Git Mastery App.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Icon Import in Dashboard Component

**Problem**: The Dashboard component was using the `FileText` icon from Lucide React, but it wasn't imported.

**Solution**: Added the missing import:
```javascript
import { Trophy, Star, BookOpen, Play, Settings, RefreshCw, GitBranch, Terminal, Github, Zap, CheckCircle, Clock, Target, Award, ChevronRight, ArrowRight, FileText } from 'lucide-react';
```

### 2. Dynamic Class Names in LessonViewer Component

**Problem**: The LessonViewer component was using string interpolation with template literals for dynamic class names, which doesn't work correctly with Tailwind CSS's purge feature.

**Solution**: Replaced dynamic class names with conditional expressions:

```javascript
// Before
className={`${colors.text} border-${moduleColor}-600`}

// After
className={`${colors.text} ${
  moduleColor === 'blue' ? 'border-blue-600' : 
  moduleColor === 'green' ? 'border-green-600' : 
  moduleColor === 'purple' ? 'border-purple-600' : 
  'border-orange-600'
}`}
```

This approach ensures that Tailwind CSS can properly identify and include the necessary classes in the production build.

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the application in your browser
3. Complete the onboarding process
4. Verify that the Dashboard loads correctly without errors
5. Navigate to a lesson and verify that the styling is applied correctly

## Additional Notes

- The application now uses a more robust approach for dynamic styling that's compatible with Tailwind CSS's purge feature
- All components have been thoroughly checked for similar issues
- The fixes maintain the enhanced UI/UX improvements made to the application
